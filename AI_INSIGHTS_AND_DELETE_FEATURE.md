      await deleteLead(id);
    }
    setLeads(leads.filter(l => !leadIds.includes(l.id)));
    setSelectedLeads([]);
  }
};
```

### 3. View Insights Button Integration
**Location:** AI Insights Banner in LeadsPage

#### Before
```typescript
<button className="flex items-center px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-purple-700 transition-colors">
  <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  View Insights
</button>
```

#### After
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => setShowAIInsights(true)}
  className="flex items-center px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-purple-700 transition-colors"
>
  <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  View Insights
</button>
```

### 4. Modal State Management
Added state to control AI Insights modal:

```typescript
const [showAIInsights, setShowAIInsights] = useState(false);
```

Integrated modal at the end of the component:

```typescript
<AIInsightsModal
  isOpen={showAIInsights}
  onClose={() => setShowAIInsights(false)}
