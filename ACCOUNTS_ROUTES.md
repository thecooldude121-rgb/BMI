- Verify AccountsProvider is wrapping the routes
- Check browser console for errors

### "Sample data missing"
- Sample data is loaded in AccountsContext from `generateSampleAccounts()`
- Verify the import in AccountsContext.tsx

### "Navigation not working"
- Sidebar link updated to `/accounts`
- Old `/crm/accounts` route removed from CRMRoutes

### "Build errors"
- All components successfully build
- Check that all imports are correct
- Verify TypeScript types are properly defined
