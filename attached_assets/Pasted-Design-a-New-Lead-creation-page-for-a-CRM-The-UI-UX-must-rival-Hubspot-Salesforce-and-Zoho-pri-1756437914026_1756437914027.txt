Bonus:

Test all user flows:

- Field-by-field reset
- Save draft/cancel
- Assign to another user
- Autosave behavior
- Validation for duplicates

Provide all major design components, verify interactions, and output code/templates in React/TypeScript.

Create a 'Lead Details' page UI/UX for a CRM platform with a focus on clarity, performance, and competitive intelligence over Hubspot, Salesforce, and Zoho.

At-a-glance lead summary (top card):
- Avatar/Initials & full lead name
- Status, lead owner, priority tag
- Company, value, source, creation date

Tabbed or vertical sections:
- Timeline: all activities, emails, calls, notes, tasks (sortable/filterable, inline logging)
- Contact Info: phone, email, address, LinkedIn/social links, vCard download
- Details: industry, lead score, custom fields, last touch
- Opportunities: related deals, value, conversion history
- Files/Notes: upload/review docs, proposal PDFs
- Smart reminders: upcoming tasks, meetings
- Changelog/history with undo

UI/UX Best Practices:
- Always-visible action bar (edit, convert, add activity, assign, mark as lost/won, duplicate, delete)
- Optimized for quick glance & rapid actions
- Hover states, skeleton loaders, empty states
- Responsive, mobile-friendly, visually balanced

Test every feature:
- Navigating sections
- Creating, editing, deleting, and linking activities
- Assigning owner/priority/status change
- Uploading/deleting files
- Timeline inline updates
- Undo actions/logs
- All error/warning states
- Mobile/responsive transitions

Provide production-grade component spec (React, TypeScript), explain UX choices, and validate all interaction flows.
