Design a best-in-class “Create Deal” page for a CRM platform. The page must be exceptionally user-friendly, guiding users through all required information with a clear, modern, and intuitive UI/UX, optimized for desktop and mobile, and noticeably better than leading CRMs (HubSpot, Zoho, Salesforce, Pipedrive).

1. UI/UX Requirements
Use a multi-section layout:

Smart form wizard with collapsible/expandable sections and progress indicators

Sticky summary/sidebar with auto-saved draft, highlighting key deal details (name, value, stage, assigned owner)

Contextual inline validation and tooltips for each field

Autofill and smart dropdowns (e.g., suggest contacts/accounts as the user types)

Desktop and mobile optimization (responsive, touch-friendly)

Minimal required fields up front; advanced/options expandable (progressive disclosure)

“Save and continue later”, “Save as template”, and “Quick add activity” buttons

2. Fields and Sections to Include
A. Ownership & Classification

Deal Owner (select from users/users groups)

Deal Type (customizable options)

Country

B. Basic Information

Deal Name (free text)

Pipeline (selectable, shows respective stages)

Account Name (link/create new)

Contact Name (suggest/search existing, or add new inline)

Country

Amount (with currency selector)

Deal Number (autogenerated on save)

Created By (auto-populated, not editable)

Closing Date (calendar picker)

Stage (dropdown, default per pipeline)

Probability (% slider or input)

C. Additional Deal Details

Products (multi-select with search or add line-item)

Platform Fee, Custom Fee, License Fee, Onboarding Fee (numeric fields with helper text/tip)

D. Activity Planning

Inline quick add: Task, Call, Meeting (all default to “Open”)

Smart suggestions: prompt to add next step based on deal type or stage (“Schedule intro call now?”)

E. Email & Communication

Display linked email threads (if contact assigned), draft message option, schedule email (calendar)

F. Stage History (hidden until saved, then shows in edit/view mode)

G. Attachments

Drag-and-drop file uploader for proposals/docs, with cloud preview/copy link

3. Features for Usability
Keyboard shortcuts and tab flow optimized for rapid data entry

“Help me fill this” AI button for smart autofill suggestions based on previous deals or templates

Autosave drafts so work is never lost

Floating action bar with main CTAs (Create, Save, Cancel)

Clear error and success messaging

4. Visual & Interactivity Details
Use soft card layouts for grouped fields, subtle shadows, and color accents based on pipeline/stage or deal value

Responsive info tooltips/icons with microcopy (e.g., “What’s a ‘Platform Fee’?”)

On mobile, sticky bottom bar for quick actions and navigation

Visual focus indicators, helpful animations/transitions, and instant feedback for every user action

5. Advanced Requests
Return component breakdowns for each section (in code)

Output all relevant API endpoints for deal creation, lookup, and validation

Include database schema for Deal, Contact, Account, Task, Product, Activity, Email, Attachment

User Actions:

“Type deal name and see live suggestions for accounts/contacts.”

“Click to add a new line item for platform fee.”

“Attach proposal by drag-and-drop before creating deal.”

“Schedule a meeting and auto-link it to the new deal.”
