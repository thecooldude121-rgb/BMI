Build a next-generation Lead Module for a CRM platform, surpassing Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Pipedrive, and Salesnayak. Prioritize automation, actionable analytics, and seamless lead-to-deal workflow.

Frontend (React + Material UI or Ant Design)
1. Lead List & Pipeline Page

Hybrid Kanban/list views with drag-and-drop stage movement.

Advanced multi-filtering (by owner, source, lead score, status, segment).

Bulk assign, tag, or trigger actions from the list; inline lead creation and editing.

Duplicate detection and merge suggestions for suspected dupes.

2. Lead Capture/Create Page

Multi-source data enrichment (form, chat, API, manual entry).

Dynamic fields that show/hide based on source, type, or logic.

Inline deduplication as you type.

Attachment upload, notes, and opt-in/consent logging.

Real-time scoring and field validation.

3. Lead Detail Page

Profile: status, owner, priority, live score, and next action.

Cross-linked account and contacts; show full organizational map.

Unified activity timeline: calls, emails, campaigns, tasks, notes, meetings, web touches—all with inline logging.

AI panel for next-best action and smart scheduling.

Buttons for direct conversion/cloning or one-click deal creation (contacts/history/files carry over).

Comprehensive audit trail (with who, when, why for every change).

4. Lead Nurturing & Assignment

Rule-driven auto-assignment and round-robin logic.

Drip campaign/journey enrollment and tracking per lead.

Trigger-based reminders (e.g., no response, overdue activity).

5. Analytics & Reporting

Interactive dashboards: stage conversion rates, bottlenecks, qualification ratios, campaign/source/channel attribution.

Lead-to-Deal conversion metrics, with clickable links to all associated deals.

Exportable reports with drill-down to individual lead details.

Backend (Node.js + Express or Python FastAPI)
REST endpoints for all Lead CRUD operations, activity logging, attachments, scoring, merging, and assignment logic.

Event/webhook system: update Deals module on lead conversion and fetch all deals related to a lead.

Business logic for automated deduplication, lead scoring, routing, and activity triggers.

Role-based field and section security.
