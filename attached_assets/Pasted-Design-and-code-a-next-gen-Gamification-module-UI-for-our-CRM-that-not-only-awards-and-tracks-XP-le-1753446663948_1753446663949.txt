Design and code a next-gen Gamification module UI for our CRM that not only awards and tracks XP, levels, streaks, badges, challenges, and leaderboards, but also features ultra-modern, interactive, and visually stunning user experiences inspired by the best current UI/UX trends. It must deliver strong engagement, drive adoption, and foster healthy user competition and collaboration.

Scope
Inspired by latest UI styles: glassmorphism, gradients, vibrant cards, subtle motion/animation, delightful microinteractions, dynamic widgets, mobile-first.

Tightly connected to CRM modules (Leads, Deals, Activities): XP, badge, level, and streak progression all triggered by core CRM actions.

Real-time, social, and personalized: Leaderboards, peer kudos, reward previews, challenge racing, and celebratory sharing.

UI & Feature Requirements
1. Dynamic Dashboard (Home Hub)
Use animated progress rings/bars for XP and streaks with gradient fills and color transitions (e.g. from blue to purple or green as progress increases).

Render summary cards for: Total XP, Current Level, Active Streak (with calendar dots or streak fire); hover or tap to expand with more details.

Add a real-time leaderboard preview widget: user’s position, gap to next tier, and “Top Movers” with animated badge/medal overlays.

Show a reward carousel/shelf for available and upcoming rewards with glowing borders and glassmorphic cards.

2. Badges & Achievements
Hero grid or badge vault with:

Each badge as a 3D-style card, glowing or animated on hover if newly earned or nearly unlocked.

Progress bars for unlockable/partial badges (“70% to Next Level”).

Show badge rarity, unlock stories, tooltips with fun stats (e.g. "Most rare badge in 2025!").

Growth journey display: XP-to-next, last five achievements in a swipeable mini-feed, and confetti/particle popup for new unlocks.

3. Streaks & Challenges
Large, animated banners for active streaks and time-limited challenges.

Real-time progress dials on each challenge card (radial progress or animated meter), bright encouragement when a user is close (“Just 2 more activities for a reward!”).

Highlight streak freezes and “save streak” bonuses in color/ripple animations.

4. Leaderboards & Social
Full-page leaderboard: vibrant cards, animated rank/medal overlays for top 3, change/highlight movements with subtle bling.

Filter options for timeframe, team, or metric; animated “riser/faller” badges for movers.

Social feed panel: recent kudos, team wins, challenge completions—with emoji reactions and sharing to Slack/Teams.

“My Impact” sidebar: show user’s XP earned this week, challenge contributions, and peer kudos.

5. Rewards & Marketplace
Interactive, glass-style cards with lock/unlock overlays, animated gradients, and reward pop-over details.

Subtle “shine” or “pulse” animations for rewards close to unlocking.

Redeem button animates to confirm, balance updates with particle or checkmark animation.

6. Personalization & Accessibility
User can swap light/dark mode and unlock new color themes as a reward.

Large, tap-friendly cards and responsive UI for perfect mobile experience.

Animated custom avatar frames and mascot/icons for profiles, rarity colors for achievement rarity.

7. Microinteractions & Delight
Animated checkmarks, confetti, popups for new badges, streaks, or level-ups.

Fun, non-intrusive “daily check-in” animations (stamp or fire/flame).

Context-aware tooltips: on hover/tap, instantly see what’s needed for next achievement or streak.

8. Manager & Analytics Views
Dynamic admin dashboards to launch challenges, see participation heatmaps, analyze which gamification elements best drive activity.

Animation/bling for top teams/users, “most improved” and weekly all-stars.

Code/Tech
Use React with Material UI v5/Ant Design/Tailwind CSS (preferably with motion/animation libraries like framer-motion or Lottie for microinteractions).

Modular folder structure; clearly commented, component-driven code.

Example data and utility files for demoing all features.

Responsive/mobile-first layouts, ARIA and keyboard accessibility for all major controls.

Include backend (Node.js/Express or Python FastAPI) sample endpoints for stat/award/history CRUD, triggered from CRM module actions/events.

Instructions:
Return complete React component code with all above features; sample backend endpoints and data models; setup instructions. Use best-practice naming and abundant code comments. Ensure every action feels responsive, celebratory, and rewarding—raising the bar in CRM gamification UX
