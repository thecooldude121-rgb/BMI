Build an enterprise-grade Contacts Module for our CRM platform, fully integrated with Leads, Deals, and Accounts modules. The module should surpass existing CRMs by delivering exceptional data quality, deep relationship mapping, seamless collaboration, and actionable insight.

Bulk actions: assign, tag, email, add to campaign, validate, or enrich contacts.

Health and engagement badges: at-risk, active, do-not-contact, recently engaged.

Save and pin custom views for prospecting/nurture campaigns.

2. Contact Creation & Import

Comms timeline: all interaction channels (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, chats, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, SMS) in one chronological feed; filterable and inline editable; attach files or notes to each event.

One-click actions: send email/SMS, schedule meeting/call, log note, or create new activity—each auto-linked to related deal/lead/account.

Linked entities: see all deals (active/historical) this contact is connected to, each with quick status and monetary value. Display all linked leads and accounts, visually mapped.

Org chart: visualize reporting structure and influencer map; drag-and-drop to adjust roles and relationships.
