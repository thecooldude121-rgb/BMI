Design and implement a Company Details page view for our AI Lead Generation platform, integrated with the BMI CRM module.  
The page must be organized with the following tabs and features:

### 1. Overview Tab
- **Company Information Section**
  - Display: Company name, Industry, Keywords, Phone number, Website, Founding year, HQ address, Employee count, Annual revenue, Ownership type, key executive team members.
- **Company Insights Section**
  - Display: Latest news mentions, technologies adopted, funding rounds/history, employee trends & charts, current/active job postings.
- **Prospects Section**
  - List view: Employees at the company, with columns for Name, Job Title, Location, Department.
  - **Actions Column:** Two buttons for each employee—"Email" (shows validated email, clickable for direct email), "Contact Number" (shows validated phone, clickable for direct call/SMS).
- **Similar Companies Section**
  - Show a curated list of similar companies (by industry, size, tech stack, region) with quick access and mini-overviews.
- **Activities Timeline Section**
  - Chronological feed of all CRM-related activities: Email correspondence, meetings, tasks, notes, calls—with filters and search.
- **Tasks Section**
  - List all open and closed tasks tied to the company account; allow task creation, assignment, status update.
- **Deals Section**
  - Display all deals associated with the company, status/tracking integrated natively with BMI CRM flows.
- **Notes Section**
  - Editable, filterable notes for this company account.

### 2. Employees Tab
- **Employee List View**
  - Table with all employees for the selected company; columns for Name, Job Title, Department, Location, Email, Phone, LinkedIn.
  - **Column Management:** User can show/hide or reorder columns as needed.
  - **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple employees for outreach/actions.
  - **Employee Profile Access:** Click any row to view deeper insight about that employee.

### General Requirements 
- All data points should be sourced and validated according to our lead gen database standards.
- Page layout should be responsive and designed for productivity: prioritize easy navigation between tabs/sections.
- Each section should have editable, actionable components (where needed) and easy export/print options.
- Prepare code stubs, UI wireframes, and database models for each major section.
- Integrate all new UI/UX features with the BMI platform’s core design language and CRM module endpoints.
