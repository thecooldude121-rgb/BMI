You are an expert AI product developer working on an advanced AI lead generation platform, fully integrated with a CRM module (BMI platform). The goal is to build a system that is superior to existing market leaders such as Apollo.io, Hunter.io, and ZoomInfo.

Design and develop the following modules and features:

1. **Core Architecture**
   - Data Aggregation Engine: Multisource crawling (web, business databases, social, proprietary).
   - AI Lead Intelligence: Machine learning for lead scoring, segmentation, enrichment.
   - CRM Integration Layer: Real-time data sync with CRM.

2. **Lead Generation**
   - AI Prospecting: NLP/predictive analytics for high-value persona/business identification.
   - Contact Discovery: Automated search for verified emails, phone, social profiles.
   - Account Enrichment: Append company data (revenue, tech stack, decision-makers, etc.).
   - Intent Scoring: Analyze digital signals for prioritization.

3. **Data Enrichment & Validation**
   - Automated data cleansing, live verification, dynamic data refresh.

4. **AI-Powered Insights**
   - Lead scoring algorithms (fit, intent, likelihood to close).
   - Persona matching and opportunity prediction.

5. **Engagement Automation**
   - Personalized campaign builder: Auto-generate outreach scripts.
   - Omnichannel sequencing (email, LinkedIn, SMS, calls).
   - A/B testing engine.

6. **CRM Integration**

7. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Insight dashboards, pipeline analytics, exportable reports and API endpoints.

8. **Compliance & Security**
   - Built-in GDPR/CCPA tools, user permissions, audit trails, and auto-purge compliance features.

9. **Differentiation**
   - Next-gen AI (deep learning for prospecting and scoring).
   - Real-time bi-directional CRM sync.
   - Modular analytics drill down.
   - Privacy by design.

Proceed to build core modules in iterative MVP fashion, prioritizing end-to-end lead lifecycle management and deep CRM integration. Output wireframes, code samples, or component designs for each module as needed.
