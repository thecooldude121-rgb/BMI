Build a next-generation Activities Module for our CRM platform. The module must deeply integrate with the Leads and Deals modules (already developed), ensuring a unified view of all business interactions. It should introduce features, workflows, and analytics that address the gaps of top CRMs and set a new standard for usability and productivity.

1. Unified Activities Dashboard
Central dashboard showing all activities (tasks, calls, meetings, emails, SMS, custom types).

Filter and search by type, owner, due date, related lead/deal/account, priority, status.

Widgets highlight “My Activities,” team workloads, unresolved or overdue, upcoming for the week, and recent completions.

Allow custom saved views per user or team.

2. Bi-Directional Integration
Link every activity to Leads, Deals, Accounts, and Contacts.

From the Activities dashboard, instantly navigate to the full profile or detail page of any related entity.

Display a unified activity timeline in the details view of Leads, Deals, Accounts that auto-syncs and color-codes all associated activities.

Enable creating a new activity directly from any lead or deal—context is pre-filled.

3. Advanced Activity Types & Details
Support core types: Task, Call, Meeting, Email, WhatsApp/SMS, Note, LinkedIn Touch, plus custom user-defined types.

Each activity captures subject/title, description, due and complete dates, owner, outcome/result, status, priority, participants, attachments, recurrence, and next action.

Allow recurring/sequence rules (e.g., “call every two weeks until deal closes”).

Fast, in-line logging and mark-complete from any view.

4. AI-Powered Automation & Insights
Smart reminders: proactive, AI-driven “next best action” and overdue notifications.

Workflow triggers to auto-create activities based on CRM events (e.g., move deal to “Negotiation” = schedule next call).

AI-generated meeting and call summaries, automatic follow-up task suggestions, and assignment recommendations.

5. Collaboration & Ownership
Internal comments and @mentions on all activities, visible in the feed and timeline.

Assign activities or share with followers/teams. Permission control for sensitive items.

Full audit/change log for every activity (assignments, completions, edits).

6. Native Integration & Logging
Two-way sync with Gmail/Outlook and Google/Outlook Calendar for meetings and emails.

Auto-log email threads, call histories, and meeting notes; include integration for click-to-call and recording storage.

Third-party integration support via API/webhooks for Slack, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn.

7. Analytics & Reporting
Dashboards show activity volume/completion rates, efficiency, bottlenecks, and type mix by user/pipeline/deal.

Conversion impact: correlate activity touchpoints with conversion rates and pipeline progress.

Exportable activity reports and visualizations.

8. User Experience
One-click activity creation and completion from anywhere.

Real-time, color-coded status (open, in progress, overdue, completed, recurring).

Bulk activity actions: assign, reassign, snooze, complete, or comment.

Fully responsive and mobile-ready; fast UI for field reps.

9. Schema & API Requirements
Entities for Activity, ActivityType, Timeline, AuditLog, with foreign key relationships to Lead, Deal, Account, Contact.

Complete REST CRUD for activities, bulk editing, reporting endpoints, and webhook/event triggers for automation.

Endpoints and code samples for seamless linkages: activity ↔ lead, activity ↔ deal, activity timeline fetch.

10. Code & Setup
Return React frontend with Material UI or Ant Design components for all dashboards, timelines, editing, and analytics.

Node.js+Express (or Python FastAPI) backend, with clean code, code comments, and extension points.

Setup instructions and code examples for activity-deal and activity-lead relationship management.

Modular project ready for new activity types and expanded workflow automation.

After generation, ensure that:

All activities across CRM are instantly visible and actionable.

Every lead or deal's detail page shows the full chronological, filterable activity timeline.

Activity creation is frictionless and context-aware—pushing collaboration, automation, and reporting far ahead of leading CRM platforms
