      transcript: `Nicholas Coston: Good afternoon everyone, let's start our regular media tech standup. Can we begin with updates on our ongoing business development initiatives and partnerships?

Venkatraj Radhakrishnan: Sure, I've been working on the Outdoor Link integration. We've made significant progress on the API connections and should have the bronze-level participation ready for the NBA Atlanta Hawks OOH event.

Nicholas Coston: That's great news. What about the Catchbox Media partnership? Are we on track for the timeline we discussed?

Venkatraj Radhakrishnan: Yes, we've established the partnership agreement and are moving forward with the integration. Also, I wanted to mention that we have new engagement with Edison Interactive regarding their golf cart digital screens project.

Nicholas Coston: Excellent. I need to follow up with Tiffany from Fan TV regarding the demo feedback and pricing discussion we had last week. Venkat, can you help me prepare some comprehensive pricing options?

Venkatraj Radhakrishnan: Absolutely. I'll send you a comprehensive list of media options in the New York City area, including subway stations and other premium locations, by tomorrow.

Nicholas Coston: Perfect. We also need to schedule a meeting with Bright Path to discuss their concepts and platforms. Let's include both of us in that meeting for early next week.

Venkatraj Radhakrishnan: I'll coordinate that. Also, I wanted to update everyone on our progress with Flo Advertising and their HyperVision 3D technology integration. The team has acknowledged good progress, and we're exploring a potential New York City media buy opportunity with multiple vendors.

Nicholas Coston: That's fantastic progress. Let's make sure we capture all action items and follow-ups before we wrap up. Any other business development updates?

Venkatraj Radhakrishnan: Just that we're continuing to explore partnerships across the board and the overall business development initiatives are tracking well.

Nicholas Coston: Excellent work everyone. Let's sync up again next week with updates on all these initiatives.`,
