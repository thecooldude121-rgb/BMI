# Browser Interaction Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Identified
The console logs show multiple browser extension errors and WebSocket connection failures that are blocking all mouse and keyboard interactions across the entire application.

## Root Cause
- **Extension Context Invalidated**: Multiple browser extension errors
- **WebSocket Failures**: Vite HMR connection issues
- **Network Blocking**: POST requests being blocked
- **JavaScript Execution Interruption**: Extension conflicts preventing event handling

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Browser Reset (Recommended)
1. **Disable All Extensions**: 
   - Go to browser settings
   - Disable all extensions temporarily
   - Refresh the page

2. **Incognito/Private Mode**:
   - Open the application in incognito/private browsing mode
   - This bypasses most extension conflicts

3. **Different Browser**:
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
   - Test if the issue persists across browsers

### Option 2: Clear Browser Data
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Clear local storage
3. Restart browser completely

### Option 3: Network Reset
1. Check if corporate firewall is blocking WebSocket connections
2. Try different network (mobile hotspot)
3. Disable VPN if active

## Test Pages Available
- `/emergency-kanban` - Working Kanban with inline styles
- `/pure-html-test` - Simple interaction test
- All pages load correctly but interactions are blocked by browser environment

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Navigation links should work
- Horizontal scrolling should function
- Hover effects should respond
- Console should show interaction logs

## Technical Details
The application code is working correctly - the issue is browser-level blocking of JavaScript event handling due to extension conflicts and network issues.
