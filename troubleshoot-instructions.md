# Browser Interaction Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Confirmed ✅
Browser extensions are blocking JavaScript interactions in normal browser mode. The application works perfectly in incognito mode, confirming this is an extension conflict issue.

## Root Cause
- **Extension Context Invalidated**: Browser extensions interfering with JavaScript
- **Event Handler Blocking**: Extensions preventing mouse/keyboard event processing
- **WebSocket Interference**: Extensions disrupting Vite HMR connections
- **Script Injection Conflicts**: Extension scripts conflicting with application code

## **SOLUTION: Use Incognito Mode**
The simplest and most effective solution is to use incognito/private browsing mode where extensions are disabled by default.

### Quick Fix Options
1. **Incognito Mode** (Recommended):
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
   - Navigate to the application URL
   - All interactions work perfectly

2. **Disable Extensions**:
   - Go to browser settings → Extensions
   - Disable all extensions temporarily
   - Refresh the application page

3. **Alternative Browser**:
   - Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
   - Test which browser has fewer conflicting extensions
